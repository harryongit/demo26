SAP 1st Day- Data Analytics and Machine Learning:
Opportunities in AI:

-> Supervised Machine Learning:(Labelled Training) (labelling the things)
-> Unsupervised Machine Learning:(Unlabelled Training) 
-> Reinforcement Learning (Gaming and Robotics)


> IR 5.0: We use all technologies from IR 4.0 but here we receive human feedback.

> LLM: Large Language Model is used to develop generative AI.

Generative AI:
->Instruct GPT (generative pretrained transformer)
 
> Chatgpt
> Google Bard: PaLM Architecture used 





> Supervised Learning: Data will be labelled
-->Classification (Categorized): Categorical problems
-->Regression (Numerical): Numerical values are predicted

> Unsupervised Learning: Data will be not labelled
--> Clustering
--> Dimensionality Reduction


AutoAI: AutoML

> When same algorithm is used for classification problem statement then it is called Classifier, when it is used for regression problem statement then it is called regressor.


Model  Evaluation:
Generalised: Model is behaving like same way at the production site like it is tested it.
Under-Fitting: Model is giving low performance.
Over-fitting: Model is giving high performance.

Objective of ML Engineer:
Is to develop the generalized model.


Instruct GPT vs Chatgpt ?
InstructGPT is designed for natural language processing tasks in specific domains, while ChatGPT is designed for conversational contexts.
InstructGPT is trained on a massive amount of diverse data, while ChatGPT is trained on conversational data.
